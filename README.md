# BMI-calculation
Today I will bring a code to calculate BMI automatically by Python code. You only need to input your weight, height in inches, and the code will do the rest.  
Certainly, BMI is a popular term that most of people hear all the time nowadays. If someone does not know it, BMI is a term describing about body mass index. BMI is used for risk assessment for the general population. Generally speaking, as a person's BMI increases, so does his or her risk of certain diseases. However, BMI does not distinguish between body fat and lean body mass and does not take into account location of body fat. For this reason, it's not an accurate measure of health for certain populations, such as people with higher than average muscle mass or people whose body composition may be skewed for other reasons.
